# TorchGWAS

TorchGWAS is a software companion repository and reproducible project with stable inputs, command-line workflows, tutorial material, and benchmark assets.

## Availability And Implementation

TorchGWAS provides:

- linear GWAS for one or more quantitative phenotypes
- preprocessing directly from raw phenotype and covariate tables
- support for `NumPy`, `PLINK`, and `BGEN` genotype sources
- an optional unrelated-sample linear workflow built on `KING/plink2` filtering
- bundled toy examples and reproducible smoke-test workflows
- benchmark summaries and manuscript-facing figure assets

The public interface is intentionally centered on raw analysis inputs.
Users provide genotype data together with phenotype and covariate tables; TorchGWAS performs sample alignment, covariate projection, and phenotype preprocessing internally.
Accordingly, precomputed `covarQ` matrices are not part of the standardized user workflow.

## Installation

```bash
cd TorchGWAS
python -m pip install -e .
```

Install the BGEN extra when BGEN is an input format:

```bash
python -m pip install -e '.[bgen]'
```

If editable installation is restricted by the local environment, the command-line interface can be invoked directly:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python -m torchgwas ...
```

## Quick Start

The repository includes a toy dataset that reproduces the complete preprocessing and association workflow:

```bash
torchgwas demo --output-dir demo_run
```

This command creates:

- `demo_run/linear/results.tsv.gz`
- `demo_run/multi/results.tsv.gz`
- `demo_run/run_summary.json`

The default user-facing workflow centers on the toy example and the linear GWAS interface.
The `demo` command also emits a multivariate result directory for exploratory comparison, but `multi` remains an extension rather than the primary entry point.

## Supported Inputs

TorchGWAS accepts the following genotype sources:

- `.npy` genotype matrices
- `PLINK` `.bed/.bim/.fam`
- `BGEN` genotype files, with an optional external `.sample` file

For cohort-scale `BGEN` analyses, TorchGWAS uses a disk-backed cache path rather than full in-memory decoding.
It decodes expected allele-2 dosage directly from the BGEN probabilities, stores `round(dosage × 127.5)` as `uint8`, and writes level-15 Zstandard frames containing 2,500 retained variants each.
Multiallelic, phased, non-diploid, incomplete, and invalid-probability variants are skipped during conversion and counted in the cache manifest; the conversion itself continues.
No cohort-level MAF, HLA/MHC, chromosome, marker-ID, or allele-alphabet filter is imposed by the converter.
The cache uses TorchGWAS's variant-major zstd dosage-store format and is reused when the BGEN and sample-file identities are unchanged.

Phenotype and covariate information may be supplied as:

- aligned matrices in `.npy`, `.csv`, or `.tsv` form
- tabular files containing an `IID` column for sample alignment

For tabular inputs, TorchGWAS uses genotype sample order as the source of truth and aligns phenotype and covariate records by `IID`.
The final aligned analysis matrices are expected to be complete and quantitative.

## Recommended Workflow

The recommended analysis sequence is:

1. provide genotype data in `NumPy`, `PLINK`, or `BGEN` form
2. provide raw phenotype and covariate tables
3. run `torchgwas prep` to validate alignment and preprocessing
4. run `torchgwas linear`
5. optionally evaluate `torchgwas multi` for exploratory phenotype-panel analyses
6. archive `run.json`, `qc.json`, and the command line together with the result tables

Illustrative command pattern:

```bash
torchgwas prep \
  --genotype /path/to/study.bed \
  --genotype-format plink \
  --phenotype-table /path/to/pheno.tsv \
  --covariates-table /path/to/covar.tsv \
  --output-dir prep_out

torchgwas linear \
  --genotype /path/to/study.bed \
  --genotype-format plink \
  --phenotype-table /path/to/pheno.tsv \
  --covariates-table /path/to/covar.tsv \
  --output-dir linear_out
```

For large `BGEN` workloads, include the sample file and optionally provide a persistent cache directory:

```bash
torchgwas linear \
  --genotype /path/to/study.bgen \
  --genotype-format bgen \
  --sample-file /path/to/study.sample \
  --genotype-cache-dir /path/to/torchgwas_cache \
  --compute-dtype float32 \
  --phenotype-table /path/to/pheno.tsv \
  --covariates-table /path/to/covar.tsv \
  --output-dir linear_out
```

When the linear workflow uses a disk-backed genotype together with `--output-dir`, TorchGWAS streams genotype chunks from disk and writes `results.tsv.gz` incrementally instead of materializing the full result table in memory.
For this large-scale path, `compute-dtype=auto` resolves to `float32` by default.
For native PLINK BED on CUDA, the two-bit calls remain packed through the
positional read and host-to-device transfer, then are decoded on the GPU. The
reader uses independent ordered chunk reads, pinned buffer reuse, and separate
copy/compute streams. GPU indices are not interchangeable: benchmark the
selected device because PCIe and NUMA topology can change its H2D bandwidth.

## Documentation

Primary user documentation is available in:

- [docs/data-format.md](docs/data-format.md)
- [docs/tutorial-linear.md](docs/tutorial-linear.md)
- [docs/tutorial-multivariate.md](docs/tutorial-multivariate.md)
- [docs/reproduce-benchmarks.md](docs/reproduce-benchmarks.md)

## Toy Workflow

The repository is organized around a tracked toy dataset under `examples/toy/`.
This path is the recommended starting point for documentation, smoke tests, and command-line examples.

Run the end-to-end demo with:

```bash
torchgwas demo --output-dir demo_run
```

Or invoke the linear workflow directly with tracked inputs:

```bash
torchgwas linear \
  --genotype examples/toy/genotype.npy \
  --phenotype-table examples/toy/pheno.tsv \
  --covariates-table examples/toy/covar.tsv \
  --marker-ids examples/toy/markers.tsv \
  --sample-ids examples/toy/samples.tsv \
  --output-dir linear_out
```

## Unrelated-Sample Linear GWAS

For studies that require unrelated samples before linear GWAS, the repository includes:

- `scripts/run_linear_unrelated.py`

This helper script:

1. runs `plink2 --king-cutoff` on the input genotype resource
2. exports an unrelated subset as `PLINK bed/bim/fam`
3. filters phenotype and covariate tables to the retained `IID`s
4. runs linear TorchGWAS on the filtered cohort

The default relatedness threshold is `0.0884`, which is the standard `KING` cutoff for removing first- and second-degree relatives.

Illustrative command pattern:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/run_linear_unrelated.py \
  --genotype /path/to/study.bgen \
  --genotype-format bgen \
  --sample-file /path/to/study.sample \
  --phenotype-table /path/to/pheno.tsv \
  --covariates-table /path/to/covar.tsv \
  --sample-id-column IID \
  --trait-columns trait1,trait2,trait3 \
  --covariate-columns SEX,AGE,PC1,PC2,PC3 \
  --output-dir unrelated_linear_run
```

Local cohort-specific helpers remain under `real_case/`, but they are not part of the default public workflow.

## Verification And Benchmarks

The repository includes two complementary reproducibility layers:

- toy example outputs in `examples/`
- toy-oriented smoke-test outputs in `examples/` and `real_case/`

Benchmark summaries and manuscript-facing assets are stored in:

- `results/benchmarks/`
- `results/figures/`

See the [benchmark summary figure](results/figures/linear_benchmark_summary.png) and the [full benchmark report](results/benchmarks/BENCHMARK_REPORT.md) for the current simulated CPU/GPU memory and runtime profiles.

These assets include PLINK concordance summaries, runtime tables, multivariate case summaries, and figure-generation scripts.
The benchmark and figure materials are primarily reported around the linear workflow; multivariate summaries are retained as exploratory assets.

## Large-Cohort Notes

The intended large-scale linear path is:

1. `BGEN probabilities -> uint8 expected dosage -> level-15 zstd cache`
2. positional reads and ordered multi-worker decompression of independent 2,500-variant frames
3. chunked linear GWAS on CPU or GPU, with `float32` compute as the recommended large-scale setting
4. filtered or compact result export for large runs, instead of writing the complete marker-by-trait long table by default

This removes the temporary text/BED conversion and reduces both host-memory pressure and persistent storage relative to full in-memory or float dosage materialization.

For large cohort runs, the recommended `linear` options are:

- `--compute-dtype float32`
- `--topk-per-trait K` to retain only the strongest associations per phenotype
- or `--p-value-threshold X` to export only associations passing a reporting threshold

Illustrative large-scale command pattern:

```bash
torchgwas linear \
  --genotype /path/to/study.bgen \
  --genotype-format bgen \
  --sample-file /path/to/study.sample \
  --genotype-cache-dir /path/to/torchgwas_cache \
  --phenotype-table /path/to/pheno.tsv \
  --covariates-table /path/to/covar.tsv \
  --compute-dtype float32 \
  --topk-per-trait 100 \
  --output-dir linear_out
```

The current out-of-core implementation applies to `linear` GWAS only.
`multi` remains experimental and does not yet support disk-backed genotype streaming.

## Scope

TorchGWAS currently focuses on a stable, documented public interface for linear association testing workflows.
The multivariate mode is retained as an experimental extension path rather than the primary advertised analysis mode.
Historical notebooks and exploratory backends from the original research environment are not treated as part of the supported public API unless explicitly migrated into this repository.
